      <h3>Idea #1</h3>
      <p>
        For football fans who enjoy the strategy and chess match of the sport, Gridiron Tactics is a turn based football game
        that puts the player in the coach's role of the play caller and decision maker at each turn.<br>
        Unlike other football games that have you directly control players in a more arcade or unrealistic fashion, our game
        will give you important team management details and tactical options that help determine the outcome of each game using realistic
        player ratings and statistics.

      <h3>Idea #2</h3>
      <p>
        For casual gamers who enjoy a fun strategy game, who might also get excited about creating prehistoric match-ups, Dino Tactics is a turn based battle game
        that will present you with strategic choices as you battle against different prehistoric beasts.<br>
        Unlike other other strategy games that may bog you down with microtransactions or a confusing amount of depth, Dino Tactics
        will strive for fun and quick gameplay with just enough depth to keep you coming back into the awesome and unlimited setting of
        prehistoric times.
